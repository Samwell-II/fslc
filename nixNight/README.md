# NixOS

> What happens when you cross theoretically awesome functional programming with your entire computer? Let's just say you might get a bit Nix'ed up. In this meeting we dive into what it means to have a truly reproducible system and leverage the power of lazy pure evaluation. We're diving head first into the Nix programming language, Nix the package manager, and NixOS itself.
